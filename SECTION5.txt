•	Duration (in minutes): "duration": 1.03,
•	Width: "width": 1280,

3.	Change the name of the entry to “This entry name shows that I’m starting to understand the Kaltura API”

Once you’re done, refresh the KMC to check and verify that the changes you made through API are reflected there.

4.	For this task you will need Fiddler or Chrome dev tools. Grab a thumbnail via API from the 4th second into a video (meaning, 00:04 minutes). 
i.	First, do it from the KMC itself when you have a network capture tool (Fiddler or Chrome dev tools) open in the background and recording. 
ii.	After you’ve accomplished this from the KMC, check out the network calls and try to identify the API calls that took place and their parameters. 
iii.	Go to the testme console and apply the same calls with the relevant parameters on a different entry. 
iv.	Please attach a short screen recording of the process.
